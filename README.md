We built a REST API using Python’s Flask framework that allows us to manage user data. The API supports four main operations:

GET – Retrieve user information

POST – Add a new user

PUT – Update an existing user

DELETE – Remove a user

Data is stored in memory using a Python dictionary, and we can test all the endpoints using Postman or curl. This project introduces us to REST principles, HTTP methods, and JSON handling with Flask.
